I am a Software Development Engineer at [Adobe, India](https://www.adobe.com/in/), as part of the Adobe Illustrator Team. The areas that interest me the most revolve around Social Network Analysis, Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning.

I completed my undergraduate studies from [IIIT-Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/) majoring in Computer Science and Engineering (with honors). I was awarded the Chancellor's Gold Medal for the best academic performance. During my B.Tech. I have worked with [Dr. Tanmoy Chakraborty](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/tanmoy) as part of the [Lab for Computational Social Systems](http://lcs2.iiitd.edu.in/) on various projects around Network Science, Graph Mining, and Social Network Analysis. I also worked with [Dr. Pushpendra Singh](https://pushpendrasingh.org/) as part of the [MÃ©lange Lab](https://melangeresearch.com/) wherein I was involved in developing human computer interaction frameworks for different use cases. In addition to this, I have some industrial research experience through internships at IBM Research, India and Adobe, India.
